# Intermittent FlatList Rendering Issue in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native intermittently fails to render items, even when data is available. The issue is not consistently reproducible and seems related to data updates and access.

## Bug Description

A FlatList component is used to display a list of items.  Under certain conditions (not fully understood), the FlatList will fail to render any items, despite the `data` prop being populated with a valid array.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the application on an Android or iOS simulator.
3. Observe that sometimes the list renders correctly and other times it shows nothing. 

## Solution

The solution provided addresses this issue by using the `keyExtractor` prop correctly and ensuring that data updates don't interfere with rendering.
